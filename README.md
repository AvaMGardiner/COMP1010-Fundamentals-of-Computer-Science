# COMP1010: Fundamentals of Computer Science

<p>In this unit, I have studied programming as a systematic discipline and have been introduced to more formal software design methods. My programming skills have been extended to include elementary data structures and abstract data types. There has been a strong emphasis on problem solving and algorithms, including aspects of correctness, complexity, and computability.</p>
