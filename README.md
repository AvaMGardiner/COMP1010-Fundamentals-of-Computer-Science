# COMP1010: Fundamentals of Computer Science

**Overview**

In this unit, I have studied programming as a systematic discipline and have been introduced to more formal software design methods. My programming skills have been extended to include elementary data structures and abstract data types. There has been a strong emphasis on problem solving and algorithms, including aspects of correctness, complexity, and computability.

**Technology Used**

- Java SE - download the latest Java SE to be compatible with the labs.
- Eclipse and Visual Studio Code - the IDEs we shall be using during the session.
