# COMP1010: Fundamentals of Computer Science

**Overview**

In this unit, I have studied programming as a systematic discipline and have been introduced to more formal software design methods. My programming skills have been extended to include elementary data structures and abstract data types. There has been a strong emphasis on problem solving and algorithms, including aspects of correctness, complexity, and computability.

**Technology Used**

- Java SE - download the latest Java SE to be compatible with the labs.
- Eclipse and Visual Studio Code - the IDEs we shall be using during the session.

**Assessment 1, 2, 3, and 4**

Throughout the semester, I was given four take-home assignments that served as an assessment of my problem-solving skills within the scope of the unit topics. Upon successful completion, I found myself capable of applying enhanced problem-solving skills to devise algorithms and implementing programs from these algorithms, demonstrating a clear understanding of the underlying architecture of the computer. I also learned to adhere to standard software engineering practices, which included documentation, unit testing, and debugging. Furthermore, I was able to compare different methods available for the same problem in terms of efficiency and other criteria. This experience also helped me demonstrate foundational learning skills, particularly active engagement in my learning process.
