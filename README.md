# COMP1010: Fundamentals of Computer Science

<p>In this unit, I have studied programming as a systematic discipline and have been introduced to more formal software design methods. My programming skills have been extended to include elementary data structures and abstract data types. There has been a strong emphasis on problem solving and algorithms, including aspects of correctness, complexity, and computability.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion of this unit, I have been able to:</p>

1. Apply enhanced problem-solving skills to develop algorithms.
2. Implement programs from algorithms, showing an understanding of the underlying architecture of the computer.
3. Adhere to standard software engineering practices, including documentation, unit testing, and debugging.
4. Compare different methods available for the same problem in terms of efficiency and other criteria.
5. Demonstrate foundational learning skills, including active engagement in my learning process.
